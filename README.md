# dsc-r-base-ics-1


## Learning Objectives 

* [ ] Get prepared to be a bit annoyed (beyond 0 indexing) 
* [ ] Simlarities in data types in R and Python
* [ ] Explain vectorization in R 
* [ ] Explain square bracket operator in R 
* [ ] Accessing parts of vector
* [ ] Vectors as a part of a dataframe 
* [ ] Lists in R 

## Getting comfortable

* let's try to r code , might get annoyed 
* can type basic things into R
* Try to type addition in console
* Now you know that DS workflow is typically more involved than typing in and dont want to run code
* Try to do keyboard shortcut to write in editor and run command 
* Notice shoots down

* Let's try this again now to assign object
* Note we use arrow not = 
* notice when run you get something in global environment 

* Can manipulate that just like in python
* But we want to do data
* So let's use r's c() opertor to make whats called a vector
* Compared to Python, first major difference of vectorzation
* Because for statiticians, numbers is what typically goes in 
* There are things like lists in R, but beyond scope of intro now
* what happens if we add or multiply vector
* All at once, no numpy needed! 

* What if we want to get a value? 
* First value, ask for first with square bracket 1 
* negative does not work same way 

* This is in one dimension

* Two dimensions is idea of a data frame 
* Let's look at iris
* Get first column
* get first row
* get combinations and : 

* Can also get vector that we had from it with $Species

* If want to write like this, check out HANDS ON PROGRAMMING
* Going to instead do tidyverse 

* This data structure will be a bit more compicated (do I go here to dataframe and $ ?)
* See hands on programming with R if you want this or r for data science 

* Install tidvyverse
